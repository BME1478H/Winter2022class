Once upon a time, in a far away kingdom there lived a rich man, who had three sons:
Simeon (a soldier), Tarras (a fat man), and Ivan (a fool).
**Tarrare, a French showman, soldier, and spy with an insatiable appetite, was known for consuming vast amounts of food, live animals, and even inanimate objects; despite numerous medical treatments to curb his hunger, he scavenged in extreme ways, including attempting to drink blood and eat corpses, and was ultimately expelled from a military hospital after being suspected of consuming a missing toddler.**
