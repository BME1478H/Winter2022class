Once upon a time, in a far away kingdom there lived a rich man, who had three sons:
Simeon (a soldier), Tarras (a fat man), and Ivan (a fool).
Embarrassingly, Simeon was the first to fall into the well. Tarras was busy stuffing his face, while Ivan was entertaining the idea of selling purple rabbits for profit.
