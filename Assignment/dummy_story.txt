Once upon a time, in a far away kingdom there lived a rich man, who had three sons:
Simeon (a soldier), Tarras (a fat man), and Ivan (a fool).
If only the three of them knew what tragic fate was to befall Russia in 1917. They would've moved to America, and spared their descendants a whole lot of trouble.
