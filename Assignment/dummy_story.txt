Once upon a time, in a far away kingdom there lived a rich man, who had three sons:
Simeon (a soldier), Tarras (a fat man), and Ivan (a fool).
One day, the rich man suddenly died and the son gathered together to decide the situation.
The fool said "I shall have all the money of my father"
The fat man said: "I shall have all the properties of my father"
The soldier said: "It doesn't matter who wants what, the king has already taken posseion of everything:.
From that day on, the three sons started a plan to get their riches back.
