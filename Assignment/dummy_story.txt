Once upon a time, in a far away kingdom there lived a rich man, who had three sons:
Simeon (a soldier), Tarras (a fat man), and Ivan (a fool).
**add a sentence here** 
Once upon a time talking to my friends face to face or going to a party was
 the most enjoyable thing that we could do, I can say it now because I know
 its values now, during the pandemic. 
Thank you, COVID-19 for reminding me this every single day in the past 8 months
